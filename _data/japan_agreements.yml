# NOTE: The JARL table contains many more rows. The above entries are an initial
# transcription and include `verified: false` where manual verification is
# recommended. If you want, I can continue and transcribe the entire table from
# the PDF (requires manual confirmation for some rows) or attempt an automated
# extraction and mark uncertainty per-row.
